## we are about to make a pull request. Yay

A pull request is the prefered mechanism to alter the MASTER branch. The MASTER branch is not a branch you do work on, it should be a reflextion of the production deployment, ie the STABLE version.

Work is done on "feature branches" and then pushed to github and a pull request is made!
